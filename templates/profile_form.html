<h1>What's your beauty type?</h1><br>
<p>Do you know what type of skin you have and which products will best suit your skin? Most people do not. Knowing the answers to these questions is essential to treating your skin properly. Skin types vary depending on factors like:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Water cotnent, which affects your skin's comfort and elasticity.</li>
        <li>Oil (lipid) content, which affects your skin's softness.</li>
        <li>Sensitivity level.</li>
        <li>Weather or level of pollution where you live.</li>
        <li>Hormones.</li>
        <li>Factors like stress, the amount of sleep you receive each night, the quantity of water you consume daily, and the types of foods you eat.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>To determine your skin type wash your face and remove all dirt, sunscreen and makeup prior to going to bed one evening. Do not use any skin care products post wash (including moisturizer). Sleep in an air conditioner & heater free environment.</p><br>
    <p>Upon waking up the following morning, do not do anything to your face. First take some time to first observe your skin from all angles, and then, take a clean piece of oil blotting tissue, or a thin piece of paper and wipe it around your face in the following areas:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>The T Zone: Consists of your forehead, nose (top and sides) and chin.</li>
        <li>The C Zone: Draw a C on the outside of your face from your temples to your jaw.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>Then answer the following questions based upon what you see.</p>
